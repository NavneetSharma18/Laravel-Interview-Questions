## Request Life Cycle
The entry point for all requests to a Laravel application is the public/index.php file. All requests are directed to this file by your web server (Apache / Nginx) configuration. 
The index.php file doesn't contain much code. Rather, it is a starting point for loading the rest of the framework. 
Next, the incoming request is sent to either the **HTTP kernel** or the console kernel, using the handleRequest or handleCommand methods of the application instance

## Service Container
Think of the Service Container as a big box (or toolbox) in Laravel where you can store things (services, classes, helpers) and later ask Laravel to give them back to you whenever you need them.
Itâ€™s mainly used for Dependency Injection â†’ instead of you creating objects manually (new Something()), you let Laravel give them to you from the box

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Services\PaymentGateway;

class OrderController extends Controller
{
    protected $payment;

    public function __construct(PaymentGateway $payment)
    {
        $this->payment = $payment; // Laravel auto-fills it from the container
    }

    public function checkout()
    {
        return $this->payment->charge(1000);
    }
}

```
##### ðŸ‘‰ Here, Laravel sees that OrderController needs a PaymentGateway, so it looks inside the Service Container and provides it. You donâ€™t write new PaymentGateway().
